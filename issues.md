# Campus Buddy - Issues & Improvements

## üö® Critical Issues

### **[CRITICAL]** Authentication Security Vulnerability: Placeholder Credentials in Production
**Tags:** `security`, `authentication`, `critical`
**Description:** The Supabase client initialization falls back to placeholder credentials when environment variables are missing, creating a critical security vulnerability that could allow unauthorized access in production environments. The application should fail gracefully with clear error messages instead of using fallback credentials.

### **[CRITICAL]** Production Deployment Failure: Hardcoded Localhost URLs
**Tags:** `deployment`, `configuration`, `critical`
**Description:** The API service defaults to `http://localhost:3001/api` when `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is not configured, causing complete API failure in production deployments where the backend service runs on different domains or ports.

### **[CRITICAL]** Development Setup Barrier: Missing Environment Configuration
**Tags:** `configuration`, `documentation`, `critical`
**Description:** Absence of `.env.example` file creates onboarding difficulties for new developers, leading to configuration errors, placeholder credential usage, and potential security issues during development and deployment.

## üîí Security Issues

### **[SECURITY]** CORS Configuration Too Permissive: Unauthorized Domain Access Risk
**Tags:** `security`, `cors`, `backend`
**Description:** The backend CORS configuration uses overly permissive regex patterns (`/^https:\/\/.*\.render\.com$/`) that allow any Render subdomain to access the API, potentially exposing endpoints to unauthorized third-party applications and increasing attack surface.

### **[SECURITY]** API Vulnerability: Missing Rate Limiting Protection
**Tags:** `security`, `backend`, `performance`
**Description:** The JSON Server API lacks rate limiting mechanisms, making it vulnerable to DDoS attacks, API abuse, and resource exhaustion. Malicious actors can make unlimited requests, potentially causing service disruption and increased infrastructure costs.

### **[SECURITY]** Information Leakage: Sensitive Data in Console Logs
**Tags:** `security`, `logging`, `frontend`
**Description:** Authentication tokens, user credentials, and personal data are being logged to console through debug functions and error handling, creating potential information leakage vulnerabilities in production environments where console logs can be accessed by end-users.

## üêõ Backend Issues

### **[BUG]** API Reliability Issue: Inconsistent Error Handling Across Service Methods
**Tags:** `error-handling`, `api`, `frontend`
**Description:** The API service methods lack uniform error handling patterns, with some methods not checking HTTP response status codes, handling JSON parsing errors, or providing meaningful error messages to users. This leads to silent failures and poor debugging experience.

### **[BUG]** Data Integrity Risk: Missing Database Validation Layer
**Tags:** `database`, `validation`, `backend`
**Description:** JSON Server doesn't enforce schema validation or data constraints, allowing invalid data (malformed emails, missing required fields, invalid dates) to be saved to the database. This can cause application crashes, data corruption, and security vulnerabilities.

### **[BUG]** Data Persistence Problem: Non-Production Ready Database Solution
**Tags:** `database`, `persistence`, `backend`
**Description:** Using JSON Server with a single `db.json` file creates data persistence risks including accidental data loss, no transaction support, concurrent access issues, and inability to scale beyond single-server deployments. This approach is unsuitable for production environments.

### **[BUG]** DateTime Inconsistency: Fragmented Date and Time Storage
**Tags:** `datetime`, `validation`, `backend`
**Description:** Events store date and time in separate fields (`event_date` and `event_time`) instead of using standardized ISO timestamps, leading to timezone handling issues, sorting problems, and internationalization challenges. This design complicates date arithmetic and display formatting.

## üé® Frontend Issues

### **[BUG]** User Experience Degradation: Missing Loading States Across API Calls
**Tags:** `ux`, `loading`, `frontend`
**Description:** Multiple components initiate API calls without displaying loading indicators, leaving users uncertain about application status during data fetching operations. This creates poor user experience, perceived performance issues, and potential user confusion or abandonment.

### **[BUG]** Application Stability Risk: Absence of Error Boundaries
**Tags:** `error-handling`, `react`, `frontend`
**Description:** The React application lacks error boundary components to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully. A single component error can crash the entire application, leaving users with blank screens and no recovery options, significantly impacting reliability and user trust.

### **[BUG]** Mobile Compatibility Issues: Inconsistent Responsive Design Implementation
**Tags:** `responsive`, `css`, `frontend`
**Description:** Several components lack proper responsive breakpoints and mobile-first design principles, resulting in broken layouts, unreadable text, and inaccessible functionality on mobile devices. This excludes a significant portion of potential users and violates modern web standards.

### **[BUG]** Memory Management Problem: Improper useEffect Cleanup Leading to Memory Leaks
**Tags:** `performance`, `react`, `frontend`
**Description:** Multiple useEffect hooks fail to properly clean up subscriptions, timers, and event listeners, causing memory leaks that accumulate over time. This can lead to degraded performance, browser crashes, and unexpected behavior in long-running sessions.

### **[BUG]** Accessibility Compliance Failure: Missing WCAG Standards Implementation
**Tags:** `accessibility`, `a11y`, `frontend`
